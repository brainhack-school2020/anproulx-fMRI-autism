## Summary 

This project's main objective will be to learn how to use machine learning and visualisation tools available in Python. The scientific purpose will be to evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms (SVM, decision tree, random forest, etc.) at a task which consists of predicting gene mutations from the functional connectivity profile observed in subjects. I will also try out different hyperparameters in order to maximise the performance of the classification.   

A second objective for this project will be to integrate as much of the tools (BIDS, Github notably) we were introduced to in the previous week allowing therefore science to be as reproducible as possible. I aim to make data visualisation as intuitive as possible. 

## Project definition 

### Background

*add 1-2 references 
* Dimensionality reductin*

I am a Master's student in Psychology currently enrolled at the University of Montreal. My main focus is in genomic imagery which consists of relating information about genetics to fonctional and structural brain phenotypes. More specifically, I am interested in functional connectivity measures in the resting-state.

### Tools 

This project will rely on the following tools: 
 * Jupyter notebook 
 * Libraries: Scikit-learn, statsmodel, nilearn
 * Github

### Data 
For the purpose of this project, I will be using an open source database / or / the Simon VIP dataset. 
*see if granted access to Simons VIP dataset

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - Readme file
 - A jupyter notebook containing the code and all visualisation graphs
 - Requirements.txt
 - Python script
